 I tried Semantic-ui-react didn't quite work out for what I want to do. Then Bootstrap 4 just released and with react router v4 , so I am going to try it.

## setup
`sudo npm -g i create-reat-app
`create-react-app my-app
`cd my-app

`yarn add bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.6
`yarn add reactstrap react-addons-transition-group react-addons-css-transition-group react react-dom

import css into src/index.js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
